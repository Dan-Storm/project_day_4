                <h2>Why Did They Bother With A Sequel?</h2>
                <p>Return to Oz, the terrifying sequel to Wizard of Oz, isn’t just disturbing. It’s also a brutally sad movie that attempts to look at the long-term effects of childhood trauma through the lens of a young girl trying to return to a fantasy world that’s been completely upended. This weird Wizard of Oz sequel fits into the canon of scary Disney movies that were either ahead of their time or just completely misguided. Like much of what happens in the land of Oz, whether you think the dark Disney movie Return to Oz is a miscalculation or a secret treasure is a matter of perspective.</p>
                <p>Scary children's movies are a necessity. They prepare kids for the dark world waiting for them upon entering adulthood and they help them understand that not everything has a happy ending. But Return to Oz may have been a little too dark. It’s a film that leans into its Jim Henson meets David Lynch aesthetic from moment one and doesn’t let up until the credits roll. Keep reading to discover the most horrifying things about Return to Oz and beware the Wheelers.</p>

                    <h3>The Wheelers</h3>
                    <p>Even if you only watched Return to Oz once, you remember the Wheelers. You probably remember these howling half-man, half-hoverboards getting far more screen time than they actually garner. As an adult it's easy to appreciate Walter Murch (the film's director) teasing the Wheelers in the real world with the orderlies pushing squeaky hospital trollies, but once these creeps start speeding around and howling at Dorothy all appreciation of semiotics and foreshadowing goes out the window. </p>
                    <p>With their Krusty the Clown-meets-Freddie Krueger laughs, the Wheelers give off the eerie feeling provided by every heroin addict you've ever had to endure on a city bus. Their limbs flail like air dancers in a used car lot and they sneer like the the imaginary faces that leer at you from darkened closet interiors - the Wheelers are desperately jockeying to be in your next nightmare. </p>

                    <h3>Account of Terror</h3>
                    <p>I was in elementary school when I first watched Walter Murch's dark, visionary 1985 film, which was marketed to children despite being one of the most legitimately terrifying “family movies” of all time. It rattled me, deeply. I couldn't stop watching it.</p>
                    <p>Released on June 21, 1985 to mixed reviews and poor box office, “Return to Oz” was the first and last directorial effort from esteemed Oscar-winning sound and film editor Walter Murch, who cut such acclaimed movies as “Julia,” “Apocalypse Now,” “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” and “The Talented Mr. Ripley.” It was not, as they say, your grandmother's “Oz” movie. The Wicked Witch of the West may have been frightening for very young kids, but she was nothing compared to the devilish, head-swapping Princess Mombi, the sadistic, baritone-voiced Nome King, and, god help us, the cackling Wheelers, a group of fluorescent roller-derby mutants who served as nightmare fodder for an entire generation of children.</p>
